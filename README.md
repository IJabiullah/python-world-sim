# *World sim*
This is a game That is like a **world simulator**. You start a country with a few people. Then you have to slowly build your country and meet peoples needs as well.

### *Features* that I want to implement are:
  1. Having a good looking **GUI**
  2. Being able to interact with most things in the environment
  3. Have an advanced enough AI that will closely mimick human behaviour for each of the citizen
